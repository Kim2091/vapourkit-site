## 2.0.0
- Filters that build TensorRT engines at runtime no longer look like a frozen app
  - A banner names the engine being built, shows progress when the builder reports it, and explains that this is the first run at that resolution; it clears when the build ends, and on every cancel/crash path
  - Engine builds are kill-safe: the engine is written to a temp file and renamed into place, so force-closing mid-build can no longer leave a truncated engine that gets reused as a cache hit and permanently breaks the filter
  - Builds are recorded in the per-item queue log, and the vs-view launch now evaluates the script first so builds happen under Vapourkit's UI instead of freezing vs-view's window
  - Covers `vs_temporalfix`'s TemporalFix (AI) engine builds too — it builds engines its own way, so its existing build log lines are recognized directly (no progress percentage available, so the banner spins)
  - Third-party filters can opt into the same banner by printing `[vk-build] begin/progress/end` lines to stderr — see the [project documentation](https://github.com/Kim2091/vapourkit-site)
- The RIFE and DPIR filter templates now use real TensorRT when the TensorRT backend is selected, instead of ONNX Runtime CUDA
  - vs-mlrt builds those engines by shelling out to `trtexec`, which the TensorRT pip wheels don't ship; Vapourkit now installs a `trtexec` shim that routes the build through its own TensorRT Python API builder (the same one the model importer uses)
  - The first run at each resolution builds an engine (a few minutes, with the banner above); later runs at that resolution start instantly from the cached engine in `data/vsmlrt-models`
  - The RIFE model packs now also install the `rife_v2` model folder, so templates can select the v2 representation with `_implementation=2`; existing installs fetch it in the background at startup
- Python packages are now installed to match your GPU vendor, detected automatically at startup
  - NVIDIA: unchanged — CUDA PyTorch, `vsjetpack[full,nvidia]`, and both vs-mlrt backends (TensorRT + ONNX Runtime)
  - AMD: `vsjetpack[full,amd]` (HIP/OpenCL/Vulkan plugins) with the DirectML backend, and no multi-GB TensorRT/CUDA stack
  - Intel and unrecognized GPUs: `vsjetpack[full,cl,vulkan]` with the DirectML backend
  - PyTorch-based filters (vs_deepdeinterlace) get CPU PyTorch on non-NVIDIA GPUs instead of being broken — slower, but they run
- Installs now clean up packages left over from a different GPU configuration before installing (e.g. TensorRT/cuDNN and CUDA PyTorch when moving to an AMD GPU), including the duplicate ONNX Runtime plugin folder that could otherwise win the autoload race
- The Plugins modal reports "not installed" when the installed package set targets a different GPU than the one detected, so reinstalling repairs it
  - Existing NVIDIA installs are recognized as-is and are not forced through a reinstall; AMD/Intel users who installed the old CUDA-only package set are prompted to reinstall to get the correct packages
- Set `VAPOURKIT_FORCE_GPU_VENDOR=nvidia|amd|intel|unknown` to override GPU detection
- Fix the RIFE and DPIR filter templates failing with `"...models\rife\rife_v4.10.onnx" not found`
  - The old zip-based vs-mlrt shipped its model zoo next to the plugin DLLs; the PyPI wheels don't, so the vsmlrt RIFE/DPIR wrappers had nothing to load
  - The needed packs (RIFE v4.10, DPIR, ~75MB) now download to `data/vsmlrt-models` during plugin install, and existing installs fetch them automatically in the background at startup; generated scripts point `vsmlrt.models_path` there so pip reinstalls can't remove them
  - Other RIFE model versions can be dropped into `data/vsmlrt-models/rife` manually
- Rework inference backends into self-contained provider modules (`electron/providers/`)
  - Each backend (TensorRT, DirectML) owns its script codegen, model-file resolution, pip packages, plugin health checks, and engine building in one place; adding a backend (NCNN, OpenVINO) no longer touches the rest of the codebase
  - The DML/TRT header toggle is now a backend dropdown driven by the provider registry, with the same selection available in Settings
  - Backend choice is now per AI-model filter: every filter defaults to "Auto" (follows the app default) and can override it in the expanded filter card; overridden filters show a badge on the collapsed card
  - Generated scripts now include a `vk_backend()` helper so custom filters follow the app-selected backend; the bundled RIFE and DPIR templates use it (RIFE previously forced DirectML on every GPU, DPIR needed a hand-edited `nvidia_gpu` flag). On the TensorRT selection, script filters get real TensorRT through the `trtexec` shim described above
  - Settings, queue items, and workflow files store a backend id (`tensorrt`/`directml`) instead of the `useDirectML` boolean; existing values migrate automatically on load
- Migrate the entire install path from manual zip downloads to PyPI
  - VapourSynth (R79), vs-mlrt (16.1), BestSource, and all of pifroggi's plugins (`vs_temporalfix`, `vs_undistort`, `vs_colorfix`, `vs_grain`, `vs_tiletools`) now install via pip
  - Native VapourSynth plugins (akarin, vszip, zsmooth, bestsource, ...) arrive automatically as dependencies of `vsjetpack[full,nvidia]` and the pifroggi packages, using the NVIDIA and JET vs-wheels package indexes
  - `vspipe.exe` and the core runtime now come from the VapourSynth wheel in `Lib\site-packages\vapoursynth`; plugins autoload from `Lib\site-packages\vapoursynth\plugins`
  - vsjetpack is no longer pinned to 1.1.0 (the old `vapoursynth==72` ABI pin is obsolete)
  - `vsview[full]` is installed with the main plugin step instead of a separate pinned install
- TensorRT engine building now uses the TensorRT Python API instead of `trtexec` (the TensorRT pip wheels don't ship trtexec)
  - The Import Model dialog still accepts trtexec-style parameters; unsupported flags are ignored with a warning
- Portable installs that reuse an existing `data` folder are migrated in place: the old portable runtime, `vs-plugins` folder, and bundled script modules that PyPI now provides are cleaned up during setup, and the Python environment is upgraded in place
  - Existing TensorRT engines were built with an older TensorRT and need rebuilding — the existing vs-mlrt version-change prompt handles clearing them
- NOTE: upgrading a **setup install** from 0.16.x or older starts fresh (the old installer's upgrade flow removes the `data` folder) — export your workflows and filters before upgrading, then re-import them
- Bundled `vs_deepdeinterlace` (not yet on PyPI) and the Hybrid scripts continue to install as before
- Groundwork for Linux support: all platform-specific filenames and the site-packages layout are centralized in `electron/constants.ts`; the pip install phases are platform-neutral, leaving only the Python bootstrap (and FFmpeg/video-compare downloads) Windows-specific
- Fix update checker falsely prompting nightly builds to "update" to the stable release they were cut from
  - Nightly version suffixes (e.g. `0.16.1-nightly.2026-05-13`) broke the version comparison; nightlies are now only offered stable releases with a strictly newer base version
- Fix vspipe crashing at startup with `v3bdg: unable to acquire api3 VSAPI, abort`
  - The bundled `fft3dfilter.dll` build contains its own API3-bridge guard that aborts the process under VapourSynth R79; it is now removed at install (fft3dfilter is unavailable until an API4 build is sourced)
  - Other API3 plugins load fine through VapourSynth's compat bridge (with deprecation warnings)
- Replace API3-only bundled plugins with API4 wheels from PyPI: mvtools, CAS, adaptivegrain, WNNM, KNLMeansCL (nlm-cuda), SCXvid, DCTFilter
- Fix vs-mlrt ONNX Runtime CUDA support: both `vapoursynth-mlrt-ort` (CPU/DirectML) and `vapoursynth-mlrt-ort-cuda` ship a `vsort.dll` and the CPU-only copy always won the autoload race; the redundant CPU-only folder is now removed post-install (the CUDA build bundles DirectML too)
- Bundled plugins now extract with skip-existing semantics so they can never overwrite pip-managed plugin files (several share identical filenames)
- Fix fresh installs on NVIDIA GPUs silently starting in DirectML mode
  - A race persisted `useDirectML=true` to localStorage before async CUDA detection resolved, permanently blocking the detection-based default
- Fix DirectML failing with `open ..._fp16_fp16.onnx failed` when a TensorRT engine model is selected
  - The engine→ONNX path mapping now understands the doubled precision suffix of custom-built engines and picks whichever ONNX candidate exists on disk
- Pre-included models now get the same ONNX auto-detection as custom imports when opening the build modal
  - Temporal frame count, precision, and static shapes were previously hardcoded (15 channels for any VSR model, precision from filename only), and the frame count was missing from the form entirely

## 0.16.1
- Fix `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'execute')` crash when canceling or restarting an upscale during the frame count probe
  - Same fix applied to the preview-segment path
- Stream BestSource indexing progress during the frame count probe so cold-cache runs don't look like a hang
  - Indexing progress now shows in the same progress bar used on first video load, and is written to the queue item log

## 0.16.0
- Auto-install plugins at the end of setup
  - Removes the manual "reinstall your plugins" step required by 0.15.0
  - Auto-retries once on transient failure; falls back to Retry / Continue-without-plugins on hard failure
- Add Privacy mode (lock icon in the header)
  - Hides preview frames, input/output filenames, queue thumbnails, and queue item names behind clickable veils
  - Notification toasts become generic so filenames don't leak to screen
  - Console auto-collapses when privacy is enabled
  - Setting persists across launches
- Add descriptive output filenames (enabled by default) — thanks @fs10102020!
  - See 0.15.1 entry below for details
- Add no-filters safety
  - Persistent banner above the Upscale button when no filters are enabled
  - Confirm dialog before upscaling with zero filters
  - Removed the old "default-upscale" silent fallback that would secretly run whichever AI model was selected first
- Add BestSource indexing progress bar under the video drop zone on first video load
- Rename Temporal Fix filters
  - `Temporal Fix V2` → `TemporalFix (AI)`
  - `Temporal Fix` → `TemporalFix (Classic)`
- Fix "Failed to initialize VSScript" on fresh installs
  - Pinned `vapoursynth==72` and `vsjetpack==1.1.0` so pip doesn't silently upgrade to an ABI-incompatible Python binding
- Fix vsview failing to launch (switched from `python -m vsview` to `vsview.exe`)
- Fix descriptive-naming regen ignoring the configured default output folder
- Fix duplicate `video-index-progress` terminal event in the `get-video-info` handler
- Fix content-length parseInt type error under newer `@types/axios`

## 0.15.1
- Add descriptive output filenames (enabled by default)
  - Output filenames now reflect your workflow instead of using a generic `_processed` suffix
  - Example: `EpisodeName-colorimetry_denoise_4x_resize2160.mkv`
  - Includes applied filters, AI model scale, and output resolution
  - Automatically truncates to 32 characters if too long
  - Manually selecting an output path disables auto-generation for that file
  - Toggle available in Settings under Processing
- Fix TypeScript compilation error in `electron/vsMlrtManager.ts`
